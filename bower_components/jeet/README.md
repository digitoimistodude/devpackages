[Jeet](http://jeet.gs) is the most advanced, yet intuitive, grid system on the market today. You can think of it like the spiritual successor to [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/).

By making use of the power of pre-processors, we can now pass real fractions (or float numbers) as context that generates a percentage based width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently sized infinitely nestable gutter.

Check out [this presentation](http://corysimmons.github.io/presentations/jeet-5) to learn more about what sets Jeet above other grid systems, then enjoy one of Jeet's many pre-processor flavors:

- [Stylus](stylus)
- [SCSS](scss)

Want to sandbox it right this very second? Fork an [SCSS](http://bit.ly/jeet6-scss) or [Stylus](http://bit.ly/jeet6-stylus) example on CodePen.
